Taste is not subjective.

Although most people would disagree, that's okay. Most people are usually wrong. The same people who think taste is merely a matter of personal preference are the same people who ruin an art gallery by hanging a purple square next to a Carravaggio painting. If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing as good art. I think it's safe to say that there is such thing as good art. 

If there's no such thing as good taste, then how can you make something better? How can you improve something if you can't even tell if it's good or bad? You were probably told as a kid that some people like these things and some people don't - who are you to decide who's right? 

Well, thankfully you can decide who's right. Chefs understand the difference between good and bad food, because they have spent a lot of time tasting good food. A cop out counter to this is that you may not like certain types of food, but that doesnt mean it's bad food. It just means your pallete hasn't developed fully, so stick with your chicken nuggets.
