The gospel according to Peter. A must read if you want to build an innovative technology company.


### My Notes

some thoughts from my reading (read a few times over)

- monopolies drive innovation, want to build one but nobody wants to admit it. "the more we compete, the less we gain"
- the last will be first 
- vertically integrate 
- the minimal viable product is not very minimal anymore
